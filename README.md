# Wordpress plugin convert from table to definition list dynamically

This plugin is made for responsive design. It is a pain in the neck for me to sh
html table narrow width device. This plugin is a soluton to show in that 
condition. The plugin generate dl html elements from each html table row. Each
dl elmens has dt having column name and dd having row cell. It means that 
information in cell towards horizontal direction is arranged towards vertical 
direction.
