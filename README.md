# A Wordpress plugin converts from table to definition list dynamically

This plugin is made for responsive design. It is a pain in the neck for me to 
show html table on narrow width device. This plugin is a solution for that 
condition. The plugin generates dl/ul html elements from each html table rows. 
Each dl element is composed dt element having column name and dd element
having row cell. 
Each ul element is composed by row cell.
It means that information in cell towards horizontal direction is 
arranged towards vertical direction. You will have a easy css to show
information in table in originally.
