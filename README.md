# Wordpress plugin convert from table to definition list dynamically

This plugin is made for responsive design. It is a pain in the neck for me to 
show html table on narrow width device. This plugin is a soluton for that 
condition. The plugin generate dl html elements from each html table row. Each
dl elmens is composed dt element having column name and dd element having row
cell. It means that information in cell towards horizontal direction is 
arranged towards vertical direction. You will have a easy css to show
information in table in originally.
