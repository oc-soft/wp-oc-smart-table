It swaps list for table, if a viewer opens your page with small width display.

== Description ==

This plugin swaps list for table, if a viewer opens your page with small width
display. The list for small width display is made from the table which you
put in page with table block editor. You do not need to write list having
same contents in table. You can enable this plugin with a simple operation.
The plugin create list on browser dynamically. So the list is not exists in
your wordpress database. You will edit the table being enabled this plugin,
even after you uninstall this plugin. 

= table structure and list structure =

Table has header which each cells are in row towards horizontally. The table
body's each cells related with header cells are in row towards horizontally.

The informations is in row towards horizontally even if you see them with small width device. But other information tends to be in row towards vertically. 
You visit a page, see from top to down. It's natural way to scroll the display
vertically. You encounter a table having long rows while scrolling, you have
stop vertical scrolling and, scroll display horizontally. At end of table row, you have to back to the start of row with scrolling and then scroll down again.

It originated in table having horizontal categolized cells arrangement.
It is not proper for me to keep table structure and show the data vertically.
It is nice for me to arrange data with list. The list data structure has the kind to arrange data towards vertically.
